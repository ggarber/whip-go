# whip-go

It includes a WHIPClient class and a simple command line client supporrting screensharing to a WHIP ingestion endpoint.

It has been tested with [janus-gateway](https://github.com/meetecho/janus-gateway) with [whip-simple-server](https://github.com/lminiero/simple-whip-server).

## Installation

```
go build
```

## Running

```
./whip-go SOURCE WHIP_ENDPOINT_URL TOKEN
```

The supported sources are either "screen" or the name of a file (f.e. "/dev/stdin") to ready raw YUV420 samples from.
